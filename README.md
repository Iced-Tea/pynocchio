very open to newcomers, and will need all the help we can get to make the best

### Dependences
Ludic Game Library makes use of other libraries to perform some of their routines:

* Python 2.7
* PySide: sudo easy_install PySide
* SmartSide: sudo easy_install SmartSide
* rarfile: sudo easy_install rarfile

You need of Qt Designer to open and edit .ui view files.
Use de "compile_ui.sh" file to compile views of project.
