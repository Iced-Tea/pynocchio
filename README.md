### Dependences
Ludic Game Library makes use of other libraries to perform some of their routines:

* To develop:
* Python 2.7
* PyQT4: 
```
* sudo apt-get install pyqt4-dev-tools
```
* Tools Qt (QtDesigner e QLinguist): 
```
sudo apt-get install qt4-designer qt4-linguist-tools qt4-dev-tools
```
* rarfile: 
```
sudo pip install rarfile
```

* To use Pynocchio, you must only install *rarfile* module.

You need of Qt Designer to open and edit .ui view files.
